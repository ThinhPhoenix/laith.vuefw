## laith.vuefw: A Versatile Vue Project Starter

This project provides a robust foundation for building modern Vue applications, leveraging a powerful combination of:

* **Vue.js:** The progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
* **Vite:** A lightning-fast development server and build tool for Vue.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and efficient styling.
* **Vue Router:** Enables seamless navigation between different components and views within your application.

### Features

* **Structured Routing:**
    * **Index.vue & 404.vue:**  These essential views are enforced to reside within the `/views` directory for organizational clarity.
    * **Dynamic Routing:** Easily add new routes by creating `PageName.vue` components within the `/views` folder.
    * **Sub-URL Support:**  Navigate through nested pages with ease using sub-URLs like `Page.Page2.Page3.Page4...PageN.vue`.
    * **ID-Based Routing:**  Create dynamic routes for specific content or user profiles using IDs, such as `Page[id][username]...[phone].vue`.
